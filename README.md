# Datathon-2024
In this Datathon challenge, we had to develop a predictive model to decide the control actions of the ailerons in F16 aircrafts based on certain attributes of the aircrafts in 
their current state. The metric of this challenge was the R^2 score. This project was developed in the Datathon 2024 held at VIT Chennai. Applying regression analysis, we secured the 14th place out of 90+ teams.
